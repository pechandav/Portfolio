<h1> Portfolio </h1>

This is a portfolio for my work done in the Full Stack Development course provided by the University of Washington

# Steps I Took

First, I created the html files that were needed for the project: 
- index.html
- portfolio.html
- contact.html
- style.css

> These files are necessary because there are three different pages on my Portfolio website.

I made sure to commit each change I made to each file part by part;
For example: Adding alt text to images would be a single commit or changing the font color of the website would be a single commit.
